# **Scrabble-game-assistant**

## **Summary of the project:**

This is the Project for my Software Engineering class, written in Jave and Vaadin.
It is a recommendation system for Scrabble game. 
Users can input up to seven scrabble tiles. Each tile has a score assigned to it. The recommendation system can suggest all the possible words made up by the input tiles 
and list them based on the score. We allow up to two wildcard tiles for the recommendation
system.
The system can keep track on the words used for each player and the score statistics for
each player. The system can save and load the player score statistics from session to
session
